# 15-Puzzle
Simple 15-Puzzle game written in C++ language. Control using arrow keys.<br>
This might not work on every machine though because it's assumed the arrow keys will send a specific stream of input.<br>
If the arrow keys send a different sequence, it should not work.

Note:<br>
The shuffle function imitates human's manual shuffle. Thus, the longer 'Shuffle' is hold, the better the shuffle result.
